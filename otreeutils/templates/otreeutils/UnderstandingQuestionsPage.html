        Please answer the following questions that aim to test your understanding of the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            If you answer all questions correctly at the first time, you will receive a bonus of AED 10.<br/>
            For each wrong attempt, AED 1 would be deducted from the bonus.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you have 2 attempts that are wrong, you will receive AED 8.
        If you have more than 10 wrong attempts, you will not receive any bonus.
    </p>


    <p>If you have already tried each question once and do not understand why your question is wrong,
        you can ask the experimenter for help. </p>
